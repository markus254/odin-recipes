                <ol>
                    <li>In a mixing bowl, add all ingredients and mix very well till the batter becomes sticky</li>
                        <li>Cover and set aside for 1-2 hours to puff up (can also leave it aside overnight)</li>
                            <li><p>In the meantime, prepare the syrup by;</p>

                                Adding sugar and water in a saucepan and bring to a boil. 
                                Lower the heat and add lemon juice (grated lemon rinds) and cardamom then simmer for about 5-8 minutes or till it’s sticky. 
                                The syrup should coat a spoon when ready</li>
                                <li>Remove from heat and set aside to cool completely</li>
                                    <li>In a wok, heat 2 cups of vegetable oil and using a small ice cream scoop or a spoon, 
                                        drop dumplings in the hot oil and fry till golden brown</li>
                                        <li>Drop in the ready dumplings in the syrup and coat them for one minute (the longer you leave them the more syrup they’ll absolve hence becoming very sweet)</li>
                                    
                </ol>
